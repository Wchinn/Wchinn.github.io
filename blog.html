        <h4> When doing this assignment it took a little for me to get used to all the lingo associated with both html and git. Another issue I was having was the formatting of html. I've never used html before so it took a little bit to get used to. By far the biggest help for this assignment was the web. I looked at countless videos and post to make sure all my formatting was correct for the posts. I also consulted with some friends that had more html experience to help me with some of the assignment.</h4>

        <h4> One challenging thing about this assignment was the size of the webpage we had to re-organize. This was very overwhelming but became less so as the webpage was coming together. To solve that problem I tried organizing the various sections of the page. I learned how to make resize things as well as create shapes and borders to help with visual clarity. I also learned that I already knew how to re-shape and resize a lot of the elements that were given. The resources that helped the most for this assignment was friends and videos. I would attempt the problem on my own and if I couldn't figure it out, I would go to an outside resource that would help with a specific task. I had to Google how to make the images re-arrange themselves when the page was adjusted. I also had to Google how to create circles with the borders given. </h4>

        <h4> One challenging part of the assignment was getting accustomed to java script. Practice with the languge helped me understand it a little better. I leanred how to use a dataset flag to store data into an html object. I found a cool method of doing a 1 line if statement. I had prior coding knowledge which helped with writing and arrays. The jsfiddle code snippets helped a lot as well as the internet and some help from w3schools.com. I compared code and learned from the examples that were given. I googled how to use javascript structs as well the .includes function.</h4>

        <h4> Using node.js was very challenging as my knowledge on it was very minimal. I used help from friends as well as some of your examples and online examples. I learned all about node.js as well as using npm to install packages. No I did not have any special insights. I did not know anything beyond basic javascript. Some helpful resoureces included the internet, your examples, lecture notes, stack overflow and help from friends. I used these resources to help me understand what I needed to do. I had to Google how to setup node.js and the fs documentation.</h4>
