        <h4> When doing this assignment it took a little for me to get used to all the lingo associated with both html and git. Another issue I was having was the formatting of html. I've never used html before so it took a little bit to get used to. By far the biggest help for this assignment was the web. I looked at countless videos and post to make sure all my formatting was correct for the posts. I also consulted with some friends that had more html experience to help me with some of the assignment.</h4>
