        <h4> When doing this assignment it took a little for me to get used to all the lingo associated with both html and git. Another issue I was having was the formatting of html. I've never used html before so it took a little bit to get used to. By far the biggest help for this assignment was the web. I looked at countless videos and post to make sure all my formatting was correct for the posts. I also consulted with some friends that had more html experience to help me with some of the assignment.</h4>

        <h4> One challenging thing about this assignment was the size of the webpage we had to re-organize. This was very overwhelming but became less so as the webpage was coming together. To solve that problem I tried organizing the various sections of the page. I learned how to make resize things as well as create shapes and borders to help with visual clarity. I also learned that I already knew how to re-shape and resize a lot of the elements that were given. The resources that helped the most for this assignment was friends and videos. I would attempt the problem on my own and if I couldn't figure it out, I would go to an outside resource that would help with a specific task. I had to Google how to make the images re-arrange themselves when the page was adjusted. I also had to Google how to create circles with the borders given. </h4>
